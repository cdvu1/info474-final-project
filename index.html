          The dataset we chose describes K-12 School Shootings. Every instance
          that involves a gun that is brandished, fired, or a bullet
          hitting the school property for any reason is documented and updated daily. 
          The dataset contains shooting incidents that date back from 1970.

         The line graph on the right displays the total shootings for the past 10 years
         from 2008 - 2018. With this, we are able to cleary see the changes over time
         with the total shootings. The dataset we chose has data from 1970, 
         but we decided to just show the last 10 years. As you scroll through the page, 
         you will be able to see the different trends over the years filtered by the firearm type.
